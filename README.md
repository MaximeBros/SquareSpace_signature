# SquareSpace Signature scheme 

The SquareSpace Signature is a signature scheme whose security relies on the hardness of the factorization of vector spaces over the finite field with q^m elements. 

This repository contains the implementation of this signature scheme in pure C. 
The code has been written by Maxime Bros and Frédéric Canaud, from the University of Limoges, France.
